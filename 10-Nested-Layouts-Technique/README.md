# 🧩 Nested Layouts Technique

Building complex interfaces requires thinking in boxes inside boxes. This module tackles advanced structuring.

## 📝 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. **Component Thinking**

- Breaking a UI down into small, reusable parts.
- Example: A tweet = Avatar container + Content container (Header + Text + Actions).

### 2. **Structuring for Flexbox/Grid**

- Grouping elements correctly so layout systems work as expected.
- Example: Wrapping two buttons in a div to keep them together on the right side.

### 3. **Debugging Layouts**

- Using colored borders to visualize the "invisible" boxes during development.

## 📂 Practical Application

- **YouTube Video Info**: Creating a complex layout with profile picture, text column, and subscriber button.
- **Social Media Posts**: Replicating a Twitter/X post structure.
