# ✨ Hovers, Transitions, and Shadows

This section focuses on **interactivity and polish**. We learn how to make the UI feel alive and responsive to user actions.

## 📝 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. **Hover Effects (`:hover`)**

- Changing styles when the user moves their mouse over an element.
- Common uses: changing button background colors, underlining links.

### 2. **Transitions**

- Making style changes smooth instead of instant.
- Syntax: `transition: property duration timing-function;` (e.g., `opacity 0.15s ease`).

### 3. **Shadows**

- **Box Shadow**: Adding depth to buttons and cards using `box-shadow`.
- **Text Shadow**: Adding styling to text elements.
- Understanding shadow offsets, blur radius, and color.

### 4. **Opacity & Transparency**

- Making elements see-through using the `opacity` property.
- Using `rgba()` colors for transparent backgrounds.
