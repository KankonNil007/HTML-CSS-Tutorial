# 📦 The div Element

The `<div>` (division) is the universal container. This folder explores how to group elements to build page structures.

## 📝 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. **Containerization**

- Grouping related elements (e.g., image + text = card).
- Styling the container to affect layout (e.g., width, background).

### 2. **Nesting**

- Placing divs inside other divs to create columns, sections, and grids.

### 3. **Inheritance**

- Understanding which styles trickle down to children (e.g., `font-family`) and which don't.

### 4. **Classes & IDs**

- Assigning `class` names for reusable styles.
- Using `id` for unique elements.

## 📂 Layout Patterns
